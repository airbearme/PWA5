## 2024-07-23 - Clean Presentation is a UX Feature

**Learning:** Submitting a pull request with generated artifacts (e.g., `test-results/`, `playwright-report/`) creates a poor and confusing experience for the code reviewer. The clarity and cleanliness of a contribution are part of the overall user experience of the development process itself. A clean PR is a UX feature for the team.

**Action:** Always verify that generated files and directories are included in the `.gitignore` file. Never commit them. This ensures my UX enhancements are presented without noise, making the review process smoother and more focused on the actual improvement.
